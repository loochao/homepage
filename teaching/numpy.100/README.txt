Hello everybody,

I'm trying to extract questions (but more importantly answers) from this very
mailing list in order to gather them on a single page. The goal is both to
offer a quick reference for new and old users and to provide also a set of
exercices for those who teach. However, it's a bit harder than I thought since
the mailing list is huge. In order to extract questions/answers and I would
need some help, if you have some free time to spare...

If you remember having asked or answered a (short) problem, could you send the
link to the post with answer, or better, write directly the formated
entry. Here is an example:


#. Find indices of non-zero elements from [1,2,0,0,4,0]

   .. code:: python

      # Author: Somebody

      print np.nonzero([1,2,0,0,4,0])


If you can provide the assumed level of the answer, that would be even better.

Here is what the page looks like so far:

(The level names came from an old-game: Dungeon Master)
