What are the processes by which animals and humans select their actions based
on their motivations and on the consequences of past actions? This is a
fundamental question in neuroscience, with implications to ethology,
psychology, economics, sociology and computer science. The basal ganglia are a
group of interconnected subcortical nuclei which have been the subject of
intensive studies in the past years, both at the computational, psychological,
anatomical and biological levels (Alexander, 1986; Mink, 1996; Gurney et al,
2001, Leblois 2006). From study of the basal ganglia’s dysfunctions
(e.g. neurodegenerative diseases), these nuclei are believed to play a
prominent role in action selection, choosing, among possible actions, to
trigger the one with the best expectancy of achievement, with regard to the
goal to be fulfilled. The place for the representation of actions and of their
contingencies with regard to motor and sensory constraints is the prefrontal
cortex, in charge of the temporal organization of behavior (O’Reilly et al,
2006). The prefrontal cortex is consequently at the crossroad of two kinds of
loops, with other cortical regions giving sensorimotor constraints from the
environment and with the basal ganglia giving reinforcement constraints in
terms of goal achievement.

A central question in cognitive computational neuroscience is to understand how
cognitive control emerge from these regions and elaborate criteria, in the
process of making an overall decision, which often require weighting various
tradeoffs (Kolling, 2012; Fiorillo C.D., 2003). A particularly important
question in this perspective is to know more precisely the nature and the
moment of the contribution of the basal ganglia in this process. As often in
this domain, this question evokes two main aspects: (i) information
representation: which kind of information is represented in these structures
and how it is exchanged between them? (ii) learning: what kind of learning is
performed in each of these structures and what is its impact on the others?
