Scientists spend more and more time writing, maintaining, and debugging
software. While techniques for doing this efficiently have evolved, only few
scientists have been trained to use them. As a result, instead of doing their
research, they spend far too much time writing deficient code and reinventing
the wheel. In [this course](https://python.g-node.org/wiki/) we will present a
selection of advanced programming techniques and best practices which are
standard in the industry, but especially tailored to the needs of a programming
scientist. Lectures are devised to be interactive and to give the students
enough time to acquire direct hands-on experience with the materials. Students
will work in pairs throughout the school and will team up to practice the newly
learned skills in a real programming project â€” an entertaining computer
game. We use the Python programming language for the entire course. Python
works as a simple programming language for beginners, but more importantly, it
also works great in scientific simulations and data analysis. We show how clean
language design, ease of extensibility, and the great wealth of open source
libraries for scientific computing and data visualization are driving Python to
become a standard tool for the programming scientist.
