I've been invited to give a tutorial on matplotlib during the EuroSciPy meeting
which will take place at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium
on August 23-27, 2012. Euroscipy is a cross-disciplinary gathering focused on
the use and development of the Python language in scientific research. This
event strives to bring together both users and developers of scientific tools,
as well as academic research and state of the art industry.
