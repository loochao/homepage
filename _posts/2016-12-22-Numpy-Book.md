I just put online a book about numpy and more specifically about vectorization
techniques. There is already a fair number of book about Numpy (see
Bibliography) and a legitimate question is to wonder if another book is really
necessary. As you may have guessed by reading these lines, my personal answer
is yes, mostly because I think there's room for a different approach
concentrating on the migration from Python to Numpy through
vectorization. There is a lot of techniques that you don't find in books and
such techniques are mostly learned through experience. The goal of this book is
to explain some of them and to make you acquire experience in the process.
The book is available at
