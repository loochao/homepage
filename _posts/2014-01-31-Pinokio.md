I've proposed and supervised (with Maxime Carrère et Grégoire Passault) a
remake of the [pinokio] project by Adam Ben-Dror (in collaboration with
Shanshan Zhou). Three students (Fabien Depraetre, Thibault Lambert, Romain
Sagean) started the project from scratch and designed, in 2 weeks, a low-cost
Pixar-like animated lamp. You can make your own by following instrutions at the
github repository. The overall cost (in material) is approximately 500$, mostly
because of motors.
