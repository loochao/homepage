Following the publication of my **open access**
book [From Python to Numpy](http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/from-python-to-numpy), I've been proposed by a publisher to make a new online book on matplotlib and scientific visualization. This publisher offers me 16% on net sales...

Whaouuu, 16% on net sales...

16% on net sales!

So I've just one question: who exactly is getting the other 84% on net sales?
