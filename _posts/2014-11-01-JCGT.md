Grids, markers, and arrows are important components in scientific
visualisation. Grids are widely used in scientific plots and help visually
locate data. Markers visualize individual points and aggregated data. Quiver
plots show vector fields, such as a velocity buffer, through regularly-placed
arrows. Being able to draw these components quickly is critical if one wants to
offer interactive visualisation. This article provides algorithms with GLSL
implementations for drawing grids, markers, and arrows using implicit surfaces
that make it possible quickly render pixel-perfect antialiased shapes.
