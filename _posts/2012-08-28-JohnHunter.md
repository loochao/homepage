John D. Hunter III, author of Matplotlib, founding board member of NumFOCUS, husband
to Miriam, and father to three daughters: Clara, Ava, and Rahel, was diagnosed
with cancer in late July 2012 after returning from his keynote address at SciPy
in Austin, TX. He passed away on August 28th from complications arising from
necessary cancer treatment. It’s a very sad day. John’s work has been a never
ending source of beauty and inspiration.

Rest in peace, John, you will be [missed](http://numfocus.org/johnhunter/).
