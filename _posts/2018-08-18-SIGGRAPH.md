I'm back from [SIGGRAPH 2018](https://s2018.siggraph.org/) in Vancouver where I gave a 1h30 course on digital
typography with [Behdad Esfahbod](http://behdad.org/). This course is an [introduction to digital
typography rendering](https://fr.slideshare.net/NicolasRougier1/siggraph-2018-digital-typography), providing key concepts of typography as well as
introducing several computer graphics techniques to render text, from the
oldest and most common techniques (texture based) to the latest methods taking
full advantage of shaders with quasi-flawless rendering.
