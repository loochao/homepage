In a previous work, we introduced a computational model of area 3b which is
built upon the neural field theory and receives input from a simplified model
of the index distal finger pad populated by a random set of touch receptors
(Merkell cells). This model has been shown to be able to self-organize
following the random stimulation of the finger pad model and to cope, to some
extent, with cortical or skin lesions. The main hypothesis of the model is that
learning of skin representations occurs at the thalamo-cortical level while
cortico-cortical connections serve a stereotyped competition mechanism that
shapes the receptive fields. To further assess this hypothesis and the validity
of the model, we reproduced in this article the exact experimental protocol of
DiCarlo et al. that has been used to examine the structure of receptive fields
in area 3b of the primary somatosensory cortex. Using the same analysis
toolset, the model yields consistent results, having most of the receptive
fields to contain a single region of excitation and one to several regions of
inhibition. We further proceeded our study using a dynamic competition that
deeply influences the formation of the receptive fields. We hypothesized this
dynamic competition to correspond to some form of somatosensory attention that
may help to precisely shape the receptive fields. To test this hypothesis, we
designed a protocol where an arbitrary region of interest is delineated on the
index distal finger pad and we either (1) instructed explicitly the model to
attend to this region (simulating an attentional signal) (2) preferentially
trained the model on this region or (3) combined the two aforementioned
protocols simultaneously. Results tend to confirm that dynamic competition
leads to shrunken receptive fields and its joint interaction with intensive
training promotes a massive receptive fields migration and shrinkage.
