I'm very pleased to teach a course on scientific visualization at the G-Node
summer school that will be held at the University of Reading, UK, September 5 -
11, 2016.

Scientists spend more and more time writing, maintaining, and debugging
software. While techniques for doing this efficiently have evolved, only few
scientists actually use them. As a result, instead of doing their research,
they spend far too much time writing deficient code and reinventing the
wheel. In this course we will present a selection of advanced programming
techniques with theoretical lectures and practical exercises tailored to the
needs of a programming scientist.
