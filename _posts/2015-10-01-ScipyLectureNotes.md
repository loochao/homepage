A new version of the [Scipy Lecture Notes] has just been released. These are a
consistent set of materials to learn the core aspects of the scientific Python
ecosystem, from beginner to expert. They are written and maintained by a set of
volunteers and published under a CC-BY license. We hope that you will find
these notes useful, for you, your colleagues, or your students.
