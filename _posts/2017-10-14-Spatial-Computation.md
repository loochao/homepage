We introduce a graphical method originating from the computer graphics domain
that is used for the arbitrary and intuitive placement of cells over a
two-dimensional manifold. Using a bitmap image as input, where the color
indicates the identity of the different structures and the alpha channel
indicates the local cell density, this method guarantees a discrete
distribution of cell position respecting the local density function. This
method scales to any number of cells, allows to specify several different
structures at once with arbitrary shapes and provides a scalable and versatile
alternative to the more classical assumption of a uniform non-spatial
distribution. Furthermore, several connection schemes can be derived from the
paired distances between cells using either an automatic mapping or a
user-defined local reference frame, providing new computational properties for
the underlying model. The method is illustrated on a discrete homogeneous
neural field, on the distribution of cones and rods in the retina and on a
coronal view of the basal ganglia. Read more on
