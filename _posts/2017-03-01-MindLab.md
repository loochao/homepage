The [Bordeaux Mindlab](https://www.facebook.com/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgroups%2Fmindlabdx%2F) (Open Lab in cognitive science and artificial intelligence) is organizing
a workshop around cellular automata at [Le Node](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Le-Node-Bordelais/398141906920040). With
Xavier Hinaut, I'll introduce 1D and 2D cellular automaton as well as reaction-diffusion automata. Resources and code are available from https://github.com/neuronalX/workshop_cellular_automaton.
