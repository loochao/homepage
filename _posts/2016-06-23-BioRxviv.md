## Abstract

This paper introduces a new hypothesis concerning the formation of habits in
the cortex of primates under the implicit supervision of the basal
ganglia. This hypothesis has been formulated using a theoretical model and
confirmed experimentally in monkeys. To do so, and prior to learning, we
inactivated the internal part of the globus pallidus (GPi, the main output
structure of the BG) with injections of muscimol and we tested monkeys on a
variant of a two-armed bandit task where two stimuli are associated with two
distinct reward probabilities (0.25 and 0.75 respectively). Unsurprisingly,
their performance in such conditions are at the chance level. However, the
theoretical model predicts that even if the performance is random, the value of
the stimuli are implicitly evaluated and learned. This has been tested and
confirmed on the next day, when inhibition has been removed: monkeys instantly
showed quasi-optimal performances, demonstrating they knew the relative value
of the two stimuli. Said differently, we managed to explicitly dissociate
reinforcement learning from Hebbian learning and demonstrated covert learning
inside the basal ganglia. These results suggest that a behavioral decision
results from both the cooperation (acquisition) and competition (expression) of
two distinct but entangled memory systems, the goal-directed system and the
habit system that may represent the two ends of the same graded phenomenon.
