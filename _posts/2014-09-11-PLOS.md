Scientific visualization is classically defined as the process of graphically
displaying scientific data. However, this process is far from direct or
automatic. There are so many different ways to represent the same data: scatter
plots, linear plots, bar plots, and pie charts, to name just a
few. Furthermore, the same data, using the same type of plot, may be perceived
very differently depending on who is looking at the figure. A more accurate
definition for scientific visualization would be a graphical interface between
people and data.
