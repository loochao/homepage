I've been invited to give a talk at the
[Robotics and the Living Conference][conference] conference that will be held
on December 9th, 2013 at the university of Cergy-Pontoise.

## About the conference

Intelligent systems require a body to interact with the environment depending
on the context. This apparently simple proposal has strong implications for the
understanding of living organisms in their complexity, but also for anyone who
wants to design robots closer to living organisms in the way they operate.

In biology, sensory and motor information is integrated with both the
morphology of the sensors and the physiology of the musculo-skeletal system,
this integration is called "Simplexity" by Alain Berthoz. Simplexity also
corresponds to the idea of reentry that perception is based on the act, rather
than the action.

In robotics and AI, the idea that the physical structure (physical) and the
function that underlies it (the computational processes) are connected is
formulated by Rolf Pfeifer with the concept of "morphological
computation". Recent developments in new materials, sensors and actuators
closest to human tissue, human sensory receptors and to human physiology will
make possible a new bio- inspired robotics.

In cognitive sciences, Kevin O'Regan suggest that it is the sensorimotor
contingencies and our action in the world that can permit us to perceive things
through our body. The incarnation of perceptual activity means, at the same
time, the structure and form of the living body plays a key role in the
dynamics of interpersonal interaction. Foe Charles Lenay, our consideration of
the body of others (the body image that everyone gives to the perception of its
partners) can propose ways of original explanation of the recognition of others
or of imitative expressions.

The counterpart of this research is the work of Nicolas Rougier in
computational neuroscience, studying in particular the interaction between the
brain, body and environment and offers an epistemological break in the concept
model. Similarly, Philippe Gaussier offers computational neuroscience models
for social and developmental robotics, or how neuronal dynamics and behaviors
emerge from interaction of the robot in its physical and social environment.
