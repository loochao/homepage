As editors-in-chief of ReScience, a journal dedicated to computational
replication, we argue that the review of software codes used in research papers
requires a departure from the conventional refereeing process (see Nature 555,
142; 2018). In addition to scientific expertise, reviewers need experience in
software development and programming languages to be able to run the code and
inspect it. They must test the source code and whether figures and/or tables
from the submitted article can be reproduced using the software, input files,
data sets and instructions supplied by the authors. In our experience,
technical problems that arise in installing and running scientific software are
resolved most effectively if authors and reviewers can discuss the issues with
one another. ReScience uses the GitHub platform for such open reviewing (see
also N. P. Rougier et al. PeerJ Comp. Sci. 3, e142; 2017).
