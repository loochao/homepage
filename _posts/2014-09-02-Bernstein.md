I'll give an invited talk about cortical plasticity at the "Approaching
Cognition from the Computational Neuroscience" perspective satellite workshop
of the Bernstein Conference to be held on September 3rd, 2014 in the Bernstein
Center for Computational Neuroscience, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany.

## About the workshop

The description of neuronal dynamics at the level of neural population activity
correlates most closely with signatures of cognitive processes in human
behavior. Indeed, this level of description seems to be privileged in achieving
an understanding of cognition, e.g. the processes behind attention,
habituation, or decision making, in neural terms. To move beyond mere
correlation, however, architectural models are needed that are based in
neuronal principles, but which also link to the sensory surfaces and the motor
processes to ground cognition and to generate overt behavior. Critically, both
neural and behavioral signatures of the process accounts must be identified and
made accessible to experimental observation.

A central issue in such a research program is to bring together constraints
that come from computational neuroscience and reflect the mechanistic
properties of neural populations and their dynamics with constraints that come
from cognitive science and define the central elements of cognition that neural
accounts must address. Thus, the goal of the workshop is to illuminate the
problems in the interface between the computational neuroscience and cognitive
science and search for answers to the question: How can we achieve models,
which explain behavior and cognitive processes and remain neurally realistic?
