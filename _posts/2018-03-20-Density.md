We introduce a graphical method originating from the computer graphics domain
that is used for the arbitrary placement of cells over a two-dimensional
manifold. Using a bitmap image whose luminance provides cell density, this
method guarantees a discrete distribution of the positions of the cells
respecting the local density. This method scales to any number of cells, allows
one to specify arbitrary enclosing shapes and provides a scalable and versatile
alternative to the more classical assumption of a uniform spatial
distribution. The method is illustrated on a discrete homogeneous neural field,
on the distribution of cones and rods in the retina and on the neural density
of a flattened piece of cortex.
