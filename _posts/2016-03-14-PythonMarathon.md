I'll give a 24h scientific [Python course] at the University of Bordeaux from
March 14th to March 18th, 2016, based on the great teaching material by
the [Software Carpentry] and the [Scipy Lecture Notes].

[Scipy Lecture Notes]: http://www.scipy-lectures.org/

**Advanced** This course aims at introducing advanced concepts of the
scientific Python eco‐system (numpy, scipy, cython, git, OpenGL). It is
intended for those with some experience of Python and basic knowledge of the
scientific stack. Note that this course requires some material to be
pre‐installed on your computer.

**Beginner** This course gives an introduction to the Python scientific
ecosystem (numpy, matplotlib) and is intended primarily for those with little
or no previous familiarity with Python, though those with prior experience of
the language might pick up some useful tips. No requirements but a computer
(any system).
