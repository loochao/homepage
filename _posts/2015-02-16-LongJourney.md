Computational neuroscience is a powerful ally in our quest to understand the
brain. Even the most simple model can shed light on the role of this or that
structure and propose new hypothesis concerning the overall brain
organization. However, any model in Science is doomed to be proved wrong or
incomplete and replaced by a more accurate one. In the meantime, for such
replacement to happen, we have first to make sure that models are actually
reproducible such that they can be tested, evaluated, criticized and ultimately
modified, replaced or even rejected. This is where the shoe pinches. If we
cannot reproduce a model in the first place, we're doomed to re-invent the
wheel again and again, preventing us from building an incremental computational
knowledge of the brain.
