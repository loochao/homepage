**What is Computational Reproducibility?** O. Guest, N.P. Rougier, 
IEEE CDS Newsletter, volume 13, number 1, 2016.

Computational modelling is the process by which phenomena found in complex
systems are expressed algorithmically. The creation of such simulations is
useful because it allows us to test whether our understanding is sophis-
ticated enough to create credible working models of the phenomena we are
studying. In neuroscience and cognitive science especially, computational
modelling comprises more than just capturing a single phenomenon, it also
implements a theory. It gives scientists a method of allowing their ideas to be
executed, i.e., for emergent properties to appear when they are implemented and
run (McClelland, 2009). In this context, a model is said to be replicable if
experiments within it can be carried out successfully using the original
codebase, with the implicit assumption that such a codebase is available.
