We (psyphine group) have been conducting a series of experiments (43
subjects) in order to investigate how people would interact with a robotic
lamp. We did not analyze yet all the data but results are pretty
amazing. People do interact with the lamp as if it was a living being with its
own agenda. Some people talked to her, some other played with her and everybody
was really puzzled by its behavior. Even us actually.
