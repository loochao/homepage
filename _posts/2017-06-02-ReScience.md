Adrian Secord introduces in "Weighted Voronoi Stippling" (2002) a techniques
for generating stipple drawings from grayscale images using weighted centroidal
Voronoi diagrams as in the traditional artis- tic technique of stippling that
places small dots of ink onto paper such that their den- sity give the
impression of tone. The paper is not accompanied by any code and, even though
the webpage of the author points to a code archive, this one is actually
nowhere to be found. We decided to replicate the method because it can be used
for di erent purpose, especially in computational biology or neuroscience where
the distribution of a cell population can be conveniently described by shades
of grey. Read more at [Rescience](http://rescience.github.io/read/).
