## Abstract

**Background** There is an apparent contradiction between experimental data
showing that the basal ganglia are involved in goal-oriented and routine
behaviors and clinical observations. Lesion or disruption by deep brain
stimulation of the globus pallidus interna has been used for various
therapeutic purposes ranging from the improvement of dystonia to the treatment
of Tourette’s syndrome. None of these approaches has reported any severe
impairment in goal-oriented or automatic movement.

**Method**: To solve this conundrum, we trained 2 monkeys to perform a variant
of a 2-armed bandit-task (with different reward contingencies). In the latter
we alternated blocks of trials with choices between familiar rewarded targets
that elicit routine behavior and blocks with novel pairs of targets that
require an intentional learning process.

**Results** Bilateral inactivation of the globus pallidus interna, by injection
of muscimol, prevents animals from learning new contingencies while performance
remains intact, although slower for the familiar stimuli. We replicate in
silico these data by adding lateral competition and Hebbian learning in the
cortical layer of the theoretical model of the cortex–basal ganglia loop that
provided the framework of our experimental approach.

**Conclusion** The basal ganglia play a critical role in the deliberative
process that underlies learning but are not necessary for the expression of
routine movements. Our approach predicts that after pallidotomy or during
stimulation, patients should have difficulty with complex decision-making
processes or learning new goal-oriented behaviors.
