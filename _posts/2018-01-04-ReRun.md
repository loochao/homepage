Scientific code is different from production software. Scientific code, by
producing results that are then analyzed and interpreted, participates in the
elaboration of scientific conclusions. This imposes specific constraints on the
code that are often overlooked in practice. We articulate, with a small
example, five characteristics that a scientific code in computational science
should possess: re-runnable, repeatable, reproducible, reusable, and
replicable. The code should be executable (re-runnable) and produce the same
result more than once (repeatable); it should allow an investigator to reobtain
the published results (reproducible) while being easy to use, understand and
modify (reusable), and it should act as an available reference for any
ambiguity in the algorithmic descriptions of the article (replicable). More at
