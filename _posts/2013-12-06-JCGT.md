Dashed stroked paths are a widely-used feature found in the vast majority of
vector-drawing software and libraries. They enable, for example, the
highlighting of a given path, such as the current selection, in drawing
software or distinguishing curves, in the case of a scientific plotting
package. This paper introduces a shader-based method for rendering arbitrary
dash patterns along any continuous polyline (smooth or broken). The proposed
method does not tessellate individual dash patterns and allows for fast and
nearly accurate rendering of any user-defined dash pattern and caps. Benchmarks
indicate a slowdown ratio between 1.1 and 2.1 with an increased memory
consumption between 3 and 6. Furthermore, the method can be used for solid
thick polylines with correct caps and joins with only a slowdown factor of 1.1.
