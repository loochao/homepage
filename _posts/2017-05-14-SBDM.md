The
[Seventh International Symposium on "Biology of Decision Making" (SBDM)](http://sbdm2017.isir.upmc.fr) will
take place on May 14-16, 2017 in Bordeaux, France. The objective of this
three-day symposium will be to gather people from different research fields
with different approaches (economics, ethology, psychiatry, neural and
computational approaches) to decision making.  The conference will include five
sessions on habitual decision-making, beliefs and decision-making, dynamics of
decision-making, boise and variability in decision-making, hormones and
decision-making. I'll give an invited talk on "Noise as a symmetry breaker".
