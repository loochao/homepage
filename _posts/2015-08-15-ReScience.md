I'm pleased to announce the launch of the [ReScience] journal. ReScience is a
peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and encourages the
explicit replication of already published research, promoting new and
open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original research is
reproducible.

To achieve such a goal, the whole editing chain is radically different from any
other traditional scientific journal. ReScience lives on github where each new
implementation is made available together with comments, explanations and
tests. Each submission takes the form of a pull request that is publicly
reviewed and tested in order to guarantee that any researcher can re-use it. If
you ever replicated computational results from the literature in your research,
ReScience is the perfect place to publish this new implementation.

## Journal philosophy

If computer science offers a large set of tools for prototyping, writing,
running, testing, validating, sharing and replicating results, computational
science still lags behind. In the best case, authors may provide the sources of
their research as a compressed archive and feel confident their research is
replicable. But this is not exactly true. Buckheit & Donoho (1995) explained
almost 20 years ago that, an article about computational result is advertising,
not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code
and data that produced the result. The computational part in computational
sciences implies the use of computers, operating systems, tools, frameworks,
libraries and data. This leads to such a large number of combinations (taking
into account the version for each component) that the chances to have the exact
same configuration as one of your colleagues are nearly zero. This draws
consequences in our respective computational approaches in order to make sure
that computational research can be actually and faithfully replicated.

ReScience is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and
encourages the explicit replication of already published research, promoting
new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original
research is reproducible. To achieve this goal, the whole publishing chain is
radically different from any other traditional scientific journal. ReScience
lives on GitHub where each new implementation of a computational study is made
available together with comments, explanations and tests. Each submission takes
the form of a pull request that is publicly reviewed and tested in order to
guarantee that any researcher can re-use it. If you ever replicated
computational results from the literature in your research, ReScience is the
perfect place to publish your new implementation.
