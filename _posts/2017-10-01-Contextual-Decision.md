Decision making tasks in changing environments with probabilistic reward
schemes present various challenges to the agents performing the task. These
agents must use the experience gained in the past trials to characterize the
environment which guides their actions. We present two models to predict an
agent's behavior in these tasks â€” a theoretical model which defines a Bayes
optimal solution to the problem under realistic task conditions. The second is
a computational model of the basal ganglia which presents a neural mechanism to
solve the same. Both the models are shown to reproduce results in behavioral
experiments and are compared to each other. This comparison allows us to
characterize the theoretical model as a bound on the neural model and the
neural model as a biologically plausible implementation of the theoretical
model. Furthermore, we predict the performance of the agents in various
stochastic regimes which could be tested in future studies.
