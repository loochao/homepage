I will co-chair (with Tiziano Zito) the program of the EuroSciPy meeting which
will be held on the Cambridge University Campus, United Kingdom on August
28-29, 2015. Euroscipy is a cross-disciplinary gathering focused on the use and
development of the Python language in scientific research. This event strives
to bring together both users and developers of scientific tools, as well as
academic research and state of the art industry.
