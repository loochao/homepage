We're pleased to announce that we've just released the first version of vispy
which is a high-performance interactive 2D/3D data visualization library
leveraging the computational power of modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)
through the OpenGL library to display very large datasets. Please have a go and
try it out, for instance by playing with the
[examples](https://github.com/vispy/vispy/tree/master/examples). Note that
vispy is still very much a work in progress. There are probably bugs and we may
apply changes to the API. Please report bugs and feature requests at our
[issue tracker](https://github.com/vispy/vispy/issues).
