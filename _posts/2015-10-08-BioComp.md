I've been invited to give a talk on "Distributed, Asynchronous, Numerical and
Adaptive computing: from neurons to behavior" at the [first workshop][workshop]
of the [GDR BioComp] that will take place in October, from 4th to 8th, 2015 in
the Saint Paul de Vence Belambra holiday center.

## About the workshop

This workshop was the opportunity to give a state of the art of the different
disciplines explored in the BioComp Research network, through several tutorial
and overview talks. Thanks to the active participation of everybody, the poster
sessions, workgroups and discussions were particularly lively. You will find
below the program of the workshop, pictures and most of the slides that were
presented.

## About the GDR BioComp

The goal of the GDR BioComp is to facilitate interdisciplinary exchanges in
France around a common goal: the realization of bio-inspired hardware systems.

We seek to understand the mechanisms at work in biological systems in order to
create chips based on natural computation, in particular neuromorphic, but also
vice versa, to build architectures hybridizing wetware and hardware as test
systems to better understand biology. In France there is a wealth of expertise
in all disciplines concerned with hardware implementations of natural
computation: biology, cognitive psychology, computational neuroscience,
mathematics, computer architecture and data processing systems,
microelectronics, nanotechnology and physics. Realizing bio-inspired chips is
complex and requires advanced skills in all these disciplines. By organizing
interdisciplinary meetings and conferences, our goal is to bring together
different communities so that they can understand each other and work
together. In addition to interdisciplinarity, one of the biggest challenges
that the researcher wishing to participate in the design and implementation of
a bio-inspired system has to face is the proliferation of this emerging
field. At every link in the chain choices must be made among the many
possibilities: what model to choose or invent, what system to build, what
materials to use for this purpose? Our objective is to explore the most
promising approaches for efficient hardware implementation of natural computing
and to realize these bio-inspired systems with different technological
substrates.
