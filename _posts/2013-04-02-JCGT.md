title:  Higher Quality 2D Text Rendering

Even though text is pervasive in most 3D applications, there is surprisingly no
native support for text rendering in OpenGL. To cope with this absence, Mark
Kilgard introduced the use of texture fonts. This technique is well know and
widely used and ensures both good performances and a decent quality in most
situations. However, the quality may degrade strongly in orthographic mode
(screen space) due to pixelation effects at large sizes and to legibility
problems at small sizes due to incorrect hinting and positioning of glyph. I
propose to revisit font texture rendering to ensure the highest quality in
orthographic mode. The method allows for both the accurate rendering and
positioning of any glyph on the screen. While the method is compatible with
complex shaping and/or layout (e.g., Arabic alphabet), these specific cases are
not studied in this article.
