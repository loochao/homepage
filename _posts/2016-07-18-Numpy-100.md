This is a collection of
[100 Numpy exercises](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100) that I have been
collected in the numpy mailing list, on stack overflow and in the numpy
documentation. I've also created some to reach the 100 limit. The goal of this
collection is to offer a quick reference for both old and new users but also to
provide a set of exercices for those who teach.
