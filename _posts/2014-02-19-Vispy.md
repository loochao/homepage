The first Vispy Code Camp will be held at the European Synchrotron Radiation
Facility in Grenoble, France, from Wednesday 19 to Friday 21 February 2014.
All the core developers (Luke Campagnola, Almar Klein, Cyrille Rossant and
myself) and several other people from ESRF will participate. We plan to make
progress on the upcoming layers, bridging the gap between low-level OpenGL and
high-level interactive visualization. We want to achieve high performance on
big data without sacrificing ease of use and quality.

If you are interested in joining us, or if you just want us to discuss a
particular feature or use case, please feel free to contact us! Finally, we
would like to thank the organizers at ESRF for their generous support.
