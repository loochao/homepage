Together with [Konrad Hinsen](http://blog.khinsen.net) I'll talk about
reproducible research and ReScience on
the [webinar series](https://github.com/alegrand/RR_webinars) organized
by [Arnaud Legrand](http://mescal.imag.fr/membres/arnaud.legrand/). I think this will be the first time Konrad and me will speak together about ReScience. Konrad will also introduce [ActivePapers](https://f1000research.com/articles/3-289/v3).
