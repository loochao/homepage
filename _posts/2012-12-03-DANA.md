DANA is a python framework whose computational paradigm is grounded on the
notion of a unit that is essentially a set of time dependent values varying
under the influence of other units via adaptive weighted connections. The
evolution of a unit's value are defined by a set of differential equations
expressed in standard mathematical notation which greatly ease their
definition. The units are organized into groups that form a model. Each unit
can be connected to any other unit (including itself) using a weighted
connection. The DANA framework offers a set of core objects needed to design
and run such models. The modeler only has to define the equations of a unit as
well as the equations governing the training of the connections. The simulation
is completely transparent to the modeler and is handled by DANA. This allows
DANA to be used for a wide range of numerical and distributed models as long as
they fit the proposed framework (e.g. cellular automata, reaction-diffusion
system, decentralized neural networks, recurrent neural networks, kernel-based
image processing, etc.).
