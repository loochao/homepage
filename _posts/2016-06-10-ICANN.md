## Abstract

We consider a biologically plausible model of the basal ganglia that is able
to learn a probabilistic two armed bandit task using reinforcement
learning. This model is able to choose the best option and to reach optimal
performances after only a few trials. However, we show in this study that the
influence of exogenous factors such as stimuli salience and/or timing seems to
prevail over optimal decision making, hence questioning the very definition of
action-selection. What are the ecological conditions for optimal action
selection ?
