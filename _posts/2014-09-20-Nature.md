It seems Nature likes very much our "Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures" article:

* [How to draw perfect figures](http://www.nature.com/news/how-to-draw-perfect-figures-1.15996)

   Jumbled charts and misleading graphs — illustrations in a paper can go wrong
   in many ways. Now, a treatise that attempts to rescue science from bad
   figures has been getting rave reviews on social media (N. P. Rougier et
   al. PLoS Comput. Biol. 10, e1003833;; 2014).

* [How to dodge the pitfalls of bad illustrations](http://www.nature.com/news/how-to-dodge-the-pitfalls-of-bad-illustrations-1.15999)

  Jumbled charts, misleading graphs, axes to nowhere — illustrations in a paper
  can go wrong in many ways. Now, a treatise that attempts to rescue science
  from bad figures has been getting rave reviews on social media. Researchers
  have also been discussing a classic paper extolling the virtues of scientific
  stupidity.
