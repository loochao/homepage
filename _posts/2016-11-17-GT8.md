I'll give an invited talk at the "Robotique & Neurosciences" workgroup meeting
in Bordeaux (LaBRi). After the first 2015 meeting, the "Robotics &
Neuroscience" workgroup organises a second Autumn Day, this time on the topic
of "Learning". The goal is to gather roboticists, modelers and
experimentalists, so as to favor interactions and collaborations.
