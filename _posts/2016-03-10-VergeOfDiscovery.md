I've been interviewed by Evgeniy Shishkin for the program
[Verge of Discovery]. You can hear me in [episode 35] talking about visual
attention, neural networks and computational neuroscience and trying to answer
questions from Evgeniy.

### Glimpse into the interview

**ES**: What is the next big obstacle that you see in this field and what
implications will this have on the world of science or your study in
particular?

**NR**: The very complexity of the brain make it very difficult to model and to
understand it. We generally use models to simplify reality in order to have a
better understanding. However, in the case of the brain, it is extremely
difficult to design simple models that still give a fair account of the
reality. Thus, the next big obstacle would be to have computational models that
are as much complex as the reality they pretend to model.

## About Verge of Discovery

Verge of discovery aims to bring scholars, intellectuals and visionaries in the
field of science and technology together under one community that has a common
goal. That goal is to change the world we live in.  We want to hear from
todayâ€™s brightest stars with the brightest ideas in their fields.

Our guests are encouraged to share their stories of how they started and what
brought them to where they are today.  We will concentrate on their story,
their passion, their successes and of course their failures.  We will ask the
most important question of WHY they are doing what they do and HOW their work
affects our daily lives.  Our guests are also encouraged to share what
resources they use, what books they read and any advice that they can share
with our listeners, their colleagues, students and knowledge lovers alike.  Our
guests are our mentors and friends and are the light of Discover Nation!
