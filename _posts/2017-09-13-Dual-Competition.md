Action-outcome and stimulus-response processes are important components of
decision making and action selection. The former adapts its response according
to the outcome while the latter is insensitive to the outcome. An unsolved
question is how these two processes interact in order to issue a unique
behavioral answer. Here we propose a model of the interaction between the
cortex, the basal ganglia and the thalamus based on a dual competition.  We
show how this competition endows the model with two regimes. One is oriented
towards action-outcome and is driven by reinforcement learning, the other is
oriented towards stimulus-response and is driven by Hebbian learning. The final
decision is made according to a combination of these two mechanisms with a
gradual transfer from the former to the latter. We confirmed these theoretical
results on primates using a two-armed bandit task and a reversible inactivation
of the internal part of the globus pallidus.
