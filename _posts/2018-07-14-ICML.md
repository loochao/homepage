I'll give a talk at the [ICML workshop](https://mltrain.cc/events/enabling-reproducibility-in-machine-learning-mltrainrml-icml-2018/)  on reproducibility: *This workshop
focuses on how to present papers from the coding perspective so that
reproducibility and replication of results in the Machine Learning community
becomes easier. Papers from the Machine Learning community are supposed to be
a valuable asset. They can help to inform and inspire future research. They can
be a useful educational tool for students. They are the driving force of
innovation and differentiation in the industry, so quick and accurate
implementation is really critical. On the research side they can help us answer
the most fundamental questions about our existence â€“ what does it mean to learn
and what does it mean to be human? Reproducibility, while not always possible
in science (consider the study of a transient astrological phenomenon like a
passing comet), is a powerful criteria for improving the quality of research. A
result which is reproducible is more likely to be robust and meaningful and
rules out many types of experimenter error (either fraud or accidental).*
