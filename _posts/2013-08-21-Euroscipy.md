I will chair the tutorial program of the EuroSciPy meeting which will take
place at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium on August
21-24, 2013. Euroscipy is a cross-disciplinary gathering focused on the use and
development of the Python language in scientific research. This event strives
to bring together both users and developers of scientific tools, as well as
academic research and state of the art industry.
