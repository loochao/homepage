Maxim Alekseevich Shemanarev, author of the antigrain geometry library has
passed away on November 26th, 2013. I did not know him personally, but I've
been really amazed by his work on the antigrain geometry library. I've never
seen such a well programmed C++ library and the output quality of the generated
graphics has never been outdone (and I know what I'm talking about).
