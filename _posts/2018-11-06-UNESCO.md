I've been invited to join the [expert meeting](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/events/programme-meetings/?tx_browser_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=44862&cHash=b33b515e0e), co-organized by UNESCO and INRIA. This event will seek to achieve the following three results:

1. Highlight the importance of preserving software in general, and software
   source code in particular as important levers of sustainable development;
   identify the resources needed to support software preservation in terms of
   infrastructural development as well as an enabling policy and legal
   framework for long-term software preservation.

2. Produce a conceptual framework for promoting software development as a
   serious field for applied and academic research, given the fact that
   software development is increasingly becoming an essential part of all
   research activities in all fields, from 'hard' to 'soft' sciences, including
   in the humanities.

3. Suggest means to develop a Global Software Registry, which will help all
   stakeholders to recognize and enable software reuse as an important part of
   all modern software developments by providing a universal catalogue that
   will index all available software components, with the metadata needed to
   properly locate and reuse them.
