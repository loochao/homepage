The [AscoErgo] (association of students in cognitive science) is organising the
first Artificial Intelligence forum in Bordeaux. I will attend the two first
days and try to answer questions from the public about AI after watching
[Blade Runner] (Thursday 24th, March, 2015, Victoire campus) and [Ex Machina]
(Friday 25th, March, 2015, Utopia movie theater).
