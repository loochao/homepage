Glumpy is a python/OpenGL library for the fast vizualization of numpy arrays,
(mainly two dimensional) that has been designed with efficiency in mind. If you
want to draw nice figures for inclusion in a scientific article, you'd better
use matplotlib. If you want to have a sense of what's going on in your
simulation while it is running, then maybe glumpy can help you.
