I've been invited to present our results on cortical plasticity and neural
fields at the 3rd International Conference on Neural Field Theory that will be
held on June 16-18, 2014, University of Reading, United Kingdom.

## About the workshop

Neural Mass Modelling and Neural Field Theory is a growing and very active area
of research with important applications in medicine and technology. Activities
range from the simulation of neural populations to the analysis of neural field
equations, from neural modelling of cognitive and psychological processes to
controlling artificial devices. The connection between these models and
measurement data, including large-scale data assimilation tasks, is of growing
interest to many researchers.

The community includes researchers from medicine, psychology, physics,
mathematics and engineering. The International Conferences on Neural Field
Theory at the University of Reading contribute to the further development and
shaping of this community by bringing together well-known and young
researchers. Ideas from different fields meet here in a truly interdisciplinary
and inspiring environment.

The 3rd International Conference on Neural Field Theory is following a highly
successful series of conferences which took place in 2010 and 2012.
