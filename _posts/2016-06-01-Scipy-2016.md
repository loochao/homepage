I'll give a beginner [tutorial] on matplotlib at [Scipy 2016]. The 15th annual
Scientific Computing with Python conference, will be held July 11-17, 2016 in
Austin, Texas. The annual SciPy Conference brings together over 650
participants from industry, academia, and government to showcase their latest
projects, learn from skilled users and developers, and collaborate on code
development.

## About the tutorial

After reviewing the main concepts for scientific figures creation (based on the
"Ten simple rules for better figures" article), we will experience specifically
the matplotlib library that provides many different types of high-quality
figures with only a few lines of code. We'll go through the creation of a
simple, but carefully crafted figure and see in the meantime the main concepts
of the library. Then, we'll go through an animation example showing the last 50
earthquakes on the planet and we'll finish the tutorial with a set of exercises
showing the main type of plots. Last, we'll have a look at available resources
for advanced uses.
