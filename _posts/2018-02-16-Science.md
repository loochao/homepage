that have afflicted psychology, medicine, and other fields over the past
decade. Just because algorithms are based on code doesn't mean experiments are
easily replicated. Far from it. Unpublished codes and a sensitivity to training
conditions have made it difficult for AI researchers to reproduce many key
results. That is leading to a new conscientiousness about research methods and
publication protocols. Last week, at a meeting of the Association for the
Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in New Orleans, Louisiana,
reproducibility was on the agenda, with some teams diagnosing the problemâ€”and
one laying out tools to mitigate it.* Read more at [**Science**](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6377/725) (paywall).
